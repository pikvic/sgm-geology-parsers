Due to the greatness of copper's conductivity, which offers the lowest electrical resistance after silver. Copper is very ductile and can be drawn into very thin wires, which serves as its primary electrical function. It is used for electrical machinery such as motors, electromagnets, generators and communication devices.Copper has been fashioned into ornamental objects and cooking utensils since the beginning of mankind. Coins have also been made of copper throughout history. Copper is also used in pigments, insecticides, and fungicides, although it has of lately been largely replaced by synthetic chemicals.Two important alloys are formed from copper. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, and bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. U.S. pennies were made out of copper until 1982, when the cost of copper exceeded the value of the penny.
