It is used as paving stones and as a veneer or facing on buildings (both for interior and exterior use).\nIt is also used as crushed stone for the usual crushed stone applications such as road and railroad bed construction. In this application it is used locally, near the source of the amphibolite. This reduces the cost of transporting non-native stone in from other sources.\nGemologists and lapidary workers have discovered that some amphibolite rock produces a shimmer effect when it is polished. They use rounded and polished pieces of amphibolite for various pieces of jewelry.\nSubstitutes and Alternative Sources\nThere are nearly limitless alternatives for the various crushed stone applications for which amphibolite is occasionally used. Any type of rock, local or imported, that can be readily quarried, crushed and transported can replace amphibolite. In the United States, limestone and granite together represent over 80% of all the crushed rock consumed annually. As noted above, amphibolite is used locally where it is easily quarried, reducing the costs of transporting rock in from other regions.\nThere are many options to amphibolite as dimension stone. Marble, granite, and quartzite, for instance, can all be polished and used as facing on the interior and exterior of buildings. In some environments even sandstone can be used for building construction. In the end, amphibolite is chosen for the particular color, texture and overall look it gives to a building. Substitutes that provide a similar look include plastics and some varieties of other dark rock like dark granite."

For this reason, it is useful industrially: It is mixed with other metals when a consistent size is required through large temperature ranges - mostly in anti-friction bearings. Antimony is also used in medicinal research, and is used as a dye to color glass.",
      "Antimony is used as a hardening alloy for lead, especially in storage batteries and cable sheaths, and also used in bearing metal, type metal, solder, collapsible tubes and foil, sheet and pipes, and semiconductor technology. Stibnite is used for metal antifriction alloys, metal type, shot, batteries, and in the manufacture of fireworks. Antimony salts are used in the rubber and textile industries, in medicine, and glassmaking.\nThe most important use of antimony in the United States is in chemicals used to impregnate plastics, textiles, rubber and other materials as a flame retardant \u2013 that is, a form of fireproofing. This is required by federal law for certain childrens\u2019 clothing. Over half the annual U.S. antimony consumption is for the manufacture of flame retardants.\nA portion of U.S. consumption is in antimony alloys. Antimony is mixed (that is, alloyed) with other metals, such as lead, to make the lead harder and stronger for use in lead-acid batteries. On the other hand, some alloys such as Babbitt Metal (an alloy of antimony, tin, copper and sometimes lead) are useful as machine bearings because they are soft and slippery. Antimony is also alloyed with tin to make pewter items such as plates, pitchers and cups, used mostly for decoration. One use of antimony, which is declining, is to make type metal for printing newspapers and magazines. Antimony is one of very few substances (bismuth and water are two others) which expand when it cools and freezes. Antimony-bearing type metal thus fills every corner of a mold used to prepare sharp type for printing. With the advent of computer printing, this use has greatly decreased.\nAntimony is also used for pigments in plastics, paints, rubber, and for a wide variety of minor uses, including medicines, fireworks and others. Antimony oxide is a brilliant yellow color, accounting for much of the pigment use.\nA tiny amount of highly purified antimony metal is used in the computer industry to make semiconductors. To be useful in this application, antimony has to be 99.999% pure!"

It has also been previously used for medicinal purposes. It is used electronically in the structure of lasers and semiconductors. It is also used as a coloring agent for paint and fireworks.",
      "Only about 5% of arsenic consumption is of the metallic element. Most of this is used to alloy (mix) arsenic with lead, copper, or other metals for specific uses. As a metalloid, arsenic is a semiconductor, like silicon. This means it conducts some electricity like a metal, but not all the electricity a true conductor like copper would conduct. Consequently, about 1/10 % of arsenic is consumed in the manufacture of gallium arsenide semiconductors for use in electronics. Some arsenic is also used in glass-making.\nThe majority of U.S. consumption is in the form of chromated copper arsenate (CCA), a chemical used as a wood preservative for telephone poles, fence posts, pilings, and foundation timbers. The CCA significantly reduces rot and eliminates wood destruction by termites, ants and other insects. However, the use of CCA is being phased out in the U.S., and a major decrease in the arsenic market is expected as a result.\nFormerly the most important use of arsenic compounds, was as an insecticide sprayed in fields and orchards. This use has entirely disappeared in most countries, due to the poisonous nature of arsenic compounds. Arsenic contamination is a problem in some well-water and may be associated with mine drainage.\nArsenic is not recovered from any waste materials or in any recycling program. Some is recovered from runoff at wood treatment facilities.\nInterestingly, a trace amount of arsenic is necessary for good health and growth of animals, including humans. 0.00001% is needed for growth and for a healthy nervous system."

(This same property is exhibited in water). This unique property, and the fact that it is highly diamagnetic, offer it numerous uses in the electronics field.",
      "Bismuth is used in a number of very different applications. Almost none of the uses is for pure metallic bismuth. The majority is consumed in bismuth alloys, and in pharmaceuticals and chemicals. The remainder is used in ceramics, paints, catalysts, and a variety of minor applications.\nAlloys of bismuth are useful for many reasons:\nBismuth and many of its alloys expand slightly when they solidify (freeze). This allows the bismuth to fill all corners of a mold to form a perfectly sharp replica of the mold or the item being replicated. This is also a valued property when used in soldering or plumbing (joining of pipes).\nMany bismuth alloys have a low melting point, sometimes even below the temperature of boiling water. Thus a bismuth-alloy casting can be covered by plastic or other material to form an intricate machine part. The bismuth-alloy core is then removed by simply melting it in hot water and pouring it out. The use of low-melting bismuth alloys is widespread in sprinkler systems in buildings. When the alloy melts in fire-heated air, the sprinkler becomes unplugged, and water sprays the fire. This application accounts for over one-third of the bismuth used in the United States each year.\nBismuth metal is relatively inert and non-toxic. It has replaced toxic lead in many applications such as plumbing, bullets, birdshot, metal alloys, soldering, and other applications.\nFourthly, many bismuth alloys are relatively soft and malleable. Malleable means that a metal can be hammered into thin sheets. Bismuth is alloyed with iron to create what is known as \u201cmalleable irons.\u201d\nBismuth compounds are used in stomach-upset medicines (hence the trademarked name Pepto-Bismol), treatment of stomach ulcers, soothing creams, and cosmetics.\nIndustry uses bismuth in a variety of other applications. Bismuth is a catalyst in the production of acrylic fibers. Bismuth replaces lead in some ceramic glazes and paints, because bismuth is non-toxic."

Kernite contains less water in its structure than Borax.\r\n\r\nBorax has numerous industrial uses. It is dissolved in water to form an alkaline antiseptic solution that is used as a disinfectant, detergent, and water softener. It is also used in the manufacture of ceramics, paint, glass, and coated paper. Another important use is as a flux to disintegrate undesired metal oxide stains on metals, and for this reason it is also used in welding.

These applications account for the majority of the Ni-cad batteries produced. The remaining represents batteries used for emergency power supplies in hospital rooms, for emergency lights, telephone exchanges, etc.\nCadmium is useful in a small number of other applications. Cadmium sulfide (also called cadmium yellow) is used as a paint pigment. Cadmium is used to make low-temperature melting alloys, such as solder and Wood\u2019s Metal for indoor sprinkler systems. The latter is an alloy of 50%Bi, 25%Pb, 12.5% Sn, and 12.5%Cd which melts at about 160 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a very hot shower. Cadmium compounds are used both in black and white and color television tubes. It is used as a stabilizing compound in plastics.\nCadmium also has the physical property of being able to absorb neutrons. As a result, it is used in nuclear reactor control rods to dampen the nuclear reaction and keep the fission reactions under control.\nChina is the world\u2019s largest consumer of cadmium, primarily for manufacturing batteries. Worldwide consumption of cadmium is stable or slightly declining, as its use is becoming more restricted due to environmental rules.\nSoluble compounds of cadmium are poisonous, although the metallic and the sulfide forms are not soluble and therefore not very poisonous."

Copper ranks second as the most-used metal in the world. The special properties of conductivity, malleability, resistance, and beauty make it so popular. The main uses of copper are electrical. Due to the greatness of copper's conductivity, which offers the lowest electrical resistance after silver. Copper is very ductile and can be drawn into very thin wires, which serves as its primary electrical function. It is used for electrical machinery such as motors, electromagnets, generators and communication devices.Copper has been fashioned into ornamental objects and cooking utensils since the beginning of mankind. Coins have also been made of copper throughout history. Copper is also used in pigments, insecticides, and fungicides, although it has of lately been largely replaced by synthetic chemicals.Two important alloys are formed from copper. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, and bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. U.S. pennies were made out of copper until 1982, when the cost of copper exceeded the value of the penny. Since 1982, pennies are now from zinc and are only plated with copper.",
      "In pure form, copper is drawn into wires or cables for power transmission, building wiring, motor and transformer wiring, wiring in commercial and consumer electronics and equipment; telecommunication cables; electronic circuitry; plumbing, heating and air conditioning tubing; roofing, flashing and other construction applications; electroplated coatings and undercoats for nickel, chrome, zinc, etc.; and miscellaneous applications. As an alloy with tin, zinc, lead, etc. (brass and bronze), it is used in extruded, rolled or cast forms in plumbing fixtures, commercial tubing, electrical contacts, automotive and machine parts, decorative hardware, coinage, ammunition, and miscellaneous consumer and commercial uses. Copper is an essential micronutrient used in animal feeds and fertilizers."

Many exotic gold ornaments from the past have been found. Especially noteworthy are the golden ornaments from the tombs of the Pharaohs in Egypt, where gold masks, statues, coins, and much jewelry was archeologically excavated. Gold has been used for coinage throughout the centuries, and is currently accepted internationally as a standard value. Nowadays, the main use of gold is for jewelry.\r\n\r\nAs pure gold is easily bent and dented, it is always alloyed with other metals when used in jewelry. This makes it more durable and practical for ornamental use. The purity of the gold based on the alloyed metal is measured in karat weight. The karat measurement determines the percentage of gold to other metals on a scale of 1 to 24 , with 24 karats being pure gold.\r\n\r\nDue to gold's distinctive properties as a metal, it has several industrial uses. It is used in photography, dentistry, coloring, and is currently being studied for cancer treatments.\r\n\r\n",
      "Most gold is used to make jewelry and other art items. Because it is chemically stable and conducts electricity so well, it is very important in electronics. Electronic applications represent a significant amount of the United States\u2019 annual gold consumption, followed by dentistry and a variety of other applications.\nGold has been very important as the standard for currency. In 1792, the United States Congress established gold and silver as the standard for the nation\u2019s money. The U.S. Department of the Treasury holds a major stockpile of gold."

The 16% represented by crushed granite (265,000 tons per year) is used in road construction and railroad beds. Larger pieces of granite are used to stabilize the land around roadways to minimize and even eliminate soil erosion.\nGranite is used extensively as dimension stone. It is used in the construction of buildings, both as building blocks and as veneers on frame structures. Because it can be smoothed to a very high polish, granite has found extensive use in memorials, headstones, monuments, carved decorations on buildings, statues and the like.

Refractory applications are those that involve extremely high heat and therefore demand materials that will not melt or disintegrate under such extreme conditions. One example of this use is in the crucibles used in the steel industry. Such refractory applications account for the majority of the usage of graphite.\nIt is also used to make brake linings, lubricants, and molds in foundries.

Tools, for instance, are made of steel and ferrosilicon.\nIn addition to tool steels, an example of \u201calloy steels,\u201d ferrosilicon is used in the manufacture of stainless steels, carbon steels, and other alloy steels.\u00a0 An alloy steel refers to all finished steels other than stainless and carbon steels. Stainless steels are used when superior corrosion resistance, hygiene, aesthetic, and wear-resistance qualities are needed.\nCarbon steels are used extensively in suspension bridges and other structural support material, and in automotive bodies, to name a few.\nSilicon is used in the aluminum industry to improve castability and weldability. Silicon-aluminum alloys tend to have relatively low strength and ductility, so other metals, especially magnesium and copper, are often added to improve strength.\nIn the chemicals industry, silicon metal is the starting point for the production of silianes, silicones, fumed silica, and semiconductor-grade silicon. Silanes are the used to make silicone resins, lubricants, anti-foaming agents, and water-repellent compounds. Silicones are used as lubricants, hydraulic fluids, electrical insulators, and moisture-proof treatments.\nSemiconductor-grade silicon is used in the manufacture of silicon chips and solar cells. Fumed silica is used as a filler in the cement and refractory materials industries, as well as in heat insulation and filling material for synthetic rubbers, polymers and grouts.\nSilica is used in ceramics and in making glass.\nSilicon is considered a semiconductor. This means that it conducts electricity, but not as well as a metal such as copper or silver. This physical property makes silicon an important commodity in the computer manufacturing business."

Consequently, any molecule similar in size to water or smaller can pass through the spaces in the zeolite. Larger molecules, however, cannot. Zeolites are therefore used as sieves or filters to remove molecules of a particular size. Liquids and gases can pass through these spaces or pores. This property is utilized in a wide variety of industrial, agricultural and home applications, such as soap and detergents, water purification systems, crop development, and in the medical field."

      "Many applications for the metal - zinc.",
      "Zinc alloys well with other metals resulting in stronger, harder metals. Brass, for example, is a mixture of copper and 20%-45% zinc.\nAdequate amounts of zinc are essential to a healthy life in all humans and animals. It is necessary for the function of a number of different enzymes. It has also been proved necessary for skin and bone growth as well as sexual maturation. The body uses zinc to process food and nutrients. When animals do not have enough zinc in their systems, they need to consume 50% more food to match the weight gain of an animal with enough zinc in its body. About 0.003% zinc is needed for proper health.\nZinc is relatively non-reactive in air or water. Consequently, it is applied in thin layers to iron and steel products that need to be protected from rusting. This process is called galvanizing. Galvanizing is done in a number of ways. Generally, the metal is dipped in molten zinc. It can also be done by electroplating or by painting on a layer of zinc compound.\nZinc is used in making rubber and paint, chemicals, agricultural applications, in the rubber industry, in TV screens, fluorescent lights and for dry cell batteries. Pennies are made of zinc \u2013 with a thin coating of copper on top.\nZinc dust is used in the removal of impurities from solution in zinc electrowinning."
